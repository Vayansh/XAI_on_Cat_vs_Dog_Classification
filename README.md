# Explainable AI on Cat vs. Dog Classification

## Motive

 The objective is to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model capable of accurately identifying whether an image contains a cat or a dog. Additionally, the 
 Shap Explainer will be employed to provide insights into the model's reasoning behind its classification decision for each image.

# Dataset Selection
 I used the cats vs. dogs classification dataset from Kaggle. This dataset is provided as a subset of photos from a much larger dataset of 3 million manually 
 annotated photos.
